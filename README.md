# My LeetCode Study Plan: Mastering 150 Top Interview Questions with Python

Welcome to my personal LeetCode study plan, where I'll be systematically tackling the top 150 interview questions using Python. My goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills, strengthen my understanding of data structures and algorithms, and ultimately excel in technical interviews. I've devised a structured approach to gradually progress through the questions, aiming to complete 2-3 questions per day, starting from easy, advancing to medium, and eventually challenging myself with hard-level questions.

## Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Getting Started

- **Week 1-2**: I'll start with easy-level questions to build a strong foundation and boost my confidence. Each day, I'll solve 2-3 easy questions from different topics such as arrays, strings, and linked lists using Python.

### Phase 2: Intermediate Level

- **Week 3-6**: Moving on to medium-level questions, I'll dive deeper into more complex topics like dynamic programming, binary trees, and graphs. Consistently solving 2-3 medium-level questions daily using Python will help me sharpen my problem-solving skills and tackle challenging problems effectively.

### Phase 3: Advanced Challenges

- **Week 7-10**: In the final phase, I'll tackle hard-level questions, pushing my limits and mastering advanced concepts such as backtracking, greedy algorithms, and advanced data structures with Python. Despite the increased difficulty, I'll maintain my pace of solving 2-3 questions per day, ensuring steady progress.

## Daily Routine

- **Morning**: Start the day by reviewing the solution to the previous day's questions and understanding the underlying concepts thoroughly.

- **Afternoon**: Dedicate focused time to solving 2-3 LeetCode questions using Python, ensuring I understand the problem statement, devise an efficient approach, and implement the solution.

- **Evening**: Reflect on the day's learnings, review any challenging concepts or techniques, and prepare a plan for the next day's questions.

## Progress Tracking

- **Daily Check-ins**: Keep track of daily progress by marking completed questions and noting down any insights or strategies learned during the day.

- **Weekly Review**: Reflect on the progress made each week, identify areas for improvement, and adjust the study plan accordingly to maintain momentum.

## Conclusion

Embarking on this LeetCode study plan is not just about solving problems; it's about continuous learning, growth, and the journey towards mastery. By committing to solving 2-3 questions daily using Python, progressing from easy to medium to hard levels, and staying consistent and disciplined, I'm confident that I'll emerge as a stronger, more confident problem solver ready to ace any technical interview challenge that comes my way. Let's embark on this exciting journey together and unleash our full potential!
